            Of course, there must be conflict to make this game 
            interesting and unique. In Fallout 4, there are four 
            main factions you can choose to be a part of, and you 
            will ultimately live your life alongside them.

        <section>
            In chronological order, you will likely first meet the 
            Minutemen, then the Brotherhood of Steel, then the 
            Railroad, and finally the Institute. Each of these 
            factions have different principles, and it is up to you 
            to decide which principles and which faction you identify 
            with most.

            What is the conflict you may ask? Well, it has to do with 
            robots–human-like robots. You see, there is a boogeyman 
            in the Commonwealth: the Institute. The Institute acts as 
            the scientific, futuristic faction that wants to blend 
            humans with technology. They created robots–which are 
            called “synths” in the game–which can hardly be 
            distinguished from a human, unless you pick apart their 
            insides. It is at first rumored, then confirmed, that this 
            faction captures humans in the night and replaces them with 
            identical synths. There is some dark lore to this faction, 
            and I suggest playing the game to discover what they might 
            be hiding.

            Now as you can probably guess, there are people who agree 
            and people who disagree on whether the Institute belongs 
            in the Commonwealth. Immediately upon meeting the Brotherhood 
            of Steel, you will know that they do not tolerate the 
            Institute and their practices. The dynamic of the Brotherhood 
            of Steel (BOS) is more military-like, with ranks and all. They 
            seek to acquire pre-war technologies and fight for the good of 
            the Commonwealth. Most notably, they are identified by their 
            power armor.

            Finally, there are the Minutemen. This group is filled with 
            do-gooders who fight anyone or anything that jepordizes the 
            safetly of the Commonwealth and its people. They appear to resemble 
            cowboys or old generals. I know I mentioned you will 
            likely run into them first, but I felt mentioning them last was 
            best. Let me explain why. They aren’t necessarily a faction. 
            The Minutemen are a militia-type group whose goal is to aid the 
            Commonwealth overall. They will help you fight the final battle 
            regardless of the outcome you may choose.
